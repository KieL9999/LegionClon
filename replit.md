## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The design adopts a dark gaming aesthetic with golden accents, consistent with the Legion expansion. UI components are accessible and customizable, built with shadcn/ui on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. The player panel is integrated into the main navigation for a cohesive user experience. The admin panel features clear visual separation, dynamic badges, golden gradients for GMs, crown icons, and a reorganized structure into "Game Administration" and "Web Settings" for improved usability. The player panel has been redesigned with modern gradient cards for statistics, including dynamic color coding for account status and neon-colored labels. Navigation buttons utilize meaningful emojis, and the homepage stats section features a symmetric, responsive grid layout with uniform card heights and enhanced typography.

### Technical Implementations

#### Frontend
The frontend uses React/TypeScript with Vite. Wouter handles client-side routing, TanStack Query manages server state, and React Hook Form with Zod provides type-safe form validation. The architecture emphasizes modularity with reusable components and comprehensive theming.

#### Backend
The backend is an Express.js application written in TypeScript with a modular structure. It abstracts database operations via a storage interface with PostgreSQL integration. The API layer handles user registration, authentication, data retrieval, dynamic content management (web features), and secure file uploads. It features organized routes, comprehensive error handling, authentication middleware, and validation with Zod schemas.

#### File Upload System
Secure file uploads are handled with Multer, including type validation (images only) and size limits (5MB). Authentication middleware ensures only administrators can upload files, which are stored in `/public/uploads/` with unique naming.

#### Dynamic Content and Site Settings
The system supports dynamic management of web features, downloads, server news, and site settings (title, favicon, SEO). It offers a triple image option for content (predefined, external URLs, file upload) and includes an auto-initialize system for default site settings.

#### Authentication and Authorization
The system features secure user registration and login with PBKDF2 password hashing and session management via HTTP-only cookies. It implements an 8-level GM hierarchy (Player to Administrator) with role-based access control.

#### Enhanced Player Panel System
The player panel includes gradient cards for player statistics: Donation Coins, Account Status (active/banned), Last Login, and Membership Date. It also features detailed account information, ban management displays, and responsive real-time data updates.

### System Design Choices

#### Data Storage
The application uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon Database) when available, with Drizzle Kit managing migrations. A MemStorage fallback provides complete functionality when PostgreSQL is unavailable. User data includes UUID-based primary keys, username, email, password, role fields, coins, ban status, ban reason, and last login timestamps.

**Development Mode Configuration:**
- **Fallback Storage**: Automatic MemStorage when DATABASE_URL is unavailable
- **Default Admin Access**: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123` (Role: Administrador)
- **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded web features and site settings for immediate testing
- **Replit Deployment**: Configured for autoscale with proper host allowance and port binding

**Database Tables:**
- `users`: Enhanced user management with 8-level role hierarchy, coins, ban management, and login tracking.
- `user_sessions`: Secure session management.
- `web_features`: Dynamic content management for the website.
- `downloads`: Dynamic download management system.
- `server_news`: News and announcements system.
- `site_settings`: Site configuration management (title, favicon, SEO, etc.).
